      "content": "The blue color of the sky is primarily due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. Here\u2019s a brief explanation:\n\n1. **Nature of Sunlight**: Sunlight, or white light, is made up of a spectrum of colors, ranging from violet to red. Each color has a different wavelength, with violet having the shortest and red having the longest.\n\n2. **Scattering of Light**: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. Shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) scatter more than longer wavelengths (red and yellow).\n\n3. **Human Perception**: Although violet light scatters even more than blue light, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and some violet light is absorbed by ozone in the atmosphere. This combination makes the sky appear predominantly blue during the day.\n\nThus, when we look up, we see a blue sky because the shorter wavelengths of light are scattered in all directions, making blue the most prominent color.
